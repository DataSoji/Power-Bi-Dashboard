# Power-Bi-Dashboard
These dashboards are created has a learning curve for my transition into data analysis
Most dataset are downloaded from kaggle
Others are scrapped from different websites using either Power BI, excl or Python
Creating an end goal before commencing on aproject is very immportant
Data Documentation is also paramount
Data cleaning provides the opportunity to interact and understand why such dataset was gathered
Clear information and graph help communicate finding better
